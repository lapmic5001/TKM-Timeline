                Scout, a young girl, shares her family's background with us. Her<br>
                father, Atticus Finch, is a lawyer based in Maycomb. After their<br>
                mother's passing, Scout and her brother Jem are brought up by<br>
                Calpurnia. The two siblings make friends with a boy called Dill,<br>
                who proposes a plan to entice Boo Radley, a secluded neighbor,<br>
                out of his home. Scout witnesses a shutter move, as if someone<br>
                were glancing out, when Dill persuades Jem to dash over and<br>
                touch Boo's house.

                Scout eagerly attends school for the first time, but she and
                her<br />
                teacher, Miss Caroline, do not get along. Jem invites the
                poor<br />
                Walter Cunningham to lunch who douses his food in molasses,<br />
                shocking Scout to the point that Calpurnia scolds her for not<br />
                being a better hostess. Back at school, an incident involving<br />
                Burris Ewell, a boy from an even poorer and less respectable<br />
                family than the Cunninghams, disillusions Scout further. She<br />
                asks if Atticus could teach her instead, and though he
                refuses,<br />
                he promises to keep reading to her.

                When school breaks for the summer, Dill returns to Maycomb,<br />
                continuing his games with Scout and Jem and eventually
                creating<br />
                one called “Boo Radley” that they suspend when Atticus
                catches<br />
                them. As Jem and Dill grow closer, Scout spends time with
                Miss<br />
                Maudie Atkinson, who tells Scout that the rumors about Boo<br />
                Radley are false. On Dill’s last day in Maycomb, Scout, Jem,
                and<br />
                Dill peer through windows at the Radley Place. They rush home<br />
                after hearing a shotgun to find the neighborhood adults
                talking<br />
                about how Mr. Nathan Radley shot at a Black man in his yard.

                On Scout’s walks home from school with Jem, they find gifts
                left<br />
                for them in a tree knothole. Maycomb endures a real winter,<br />
                allowing the children to build a snowman that looks so much
                like<br />
                Mr. Avery that Atticus demands them to disguise it. That
                night,<br />
                Scout is woken up to find that Miss Maudie’s house is on
                fire,<br />
                and while outside someone drapes a blanket over her, which
                they<br />
                later realize was Boo Radley’s doing. Jem reveals the whole<br />
                story of the knothole and the presents, and Atticus tells
                them<br />
                to keep it to themselves.

                Scout nearly starts a fight when a classmate uses a racial
                slur<br />
                to declare that Atticus defends Black people, particularly
                Tom<br />
                Robinson, who was accused of raping a white woman. Atticus
                says<br />
                that Tom is innocent but doomed, since it’s inconceivable
                that<br />
                an all-white jury would acquit him. One day, Atticus
                surprises<br />
                Jem and Scout when he shoots a mad dog from a considerable<br />
                distance. Mrs. Dubose, a cantankerous old lady, tells the<br />
                children that Atticus is not any better than the people he<br />
                advocates for, causing Jem to lose his temper and destroy all
                of<br />
                Mrs. Dubose’s camellia bushes. As punishment, Jem goes to her<br />
                house every day to read to her, and when she dies because of
                her<br />
                morphine addiction, she leaves Jem a box with a single camellia.

                Tom Robinson’s trial draws near, and Atticus’s role as his<br />
                defense lawyer subjects Jem and Scout to town gossip. Scout
                gets<br />
                into a fight with Jem after he asks her not to antagonize<br />
                Alexandra, and when she goes to bed, she finds Dill hiding<br />
                underneath it. Sherriff Heck Tate appears at the Finch home
                and<br />
                expresses concerns about the possibility of a lynch mob
                arising<br />
                as Tom Robinson is being moved to the Maycomb jail. Atticus
                sits<br />
                outside of the jail reading, and when a group of men threaten<br />
                Atticus to move, Scout intervenes.

                called. Atticus has him write his name, pointing out that Bob
                is<br />

                During Atticus’s fiery cross-examination of Mayella, Mayella<br />
                yells at the courtroom to convict Tom Robinson, eventually<br />
                crying and refusing to answer any more questions. Tom’s<br />
                testimony explains how he often would help Mayella with
                chores,<br />
                and how on the night of the alleged rape, it was actually<br />
                Mayella who attempted to pursue Tom. When Bob appeared,
                forcing<br />
                Tom to flee, Bob threatened to kill Mayella. Link Deas is
                thrown<br />
                out of the courtroom when he defends Tom. Dill becomes so
                upset<br />
                that Scout has to take him out of the courtroom.

                As school starts, the shadow of the trial still hangs over<br />
                Scout. Bob Ewell, who loses his job, blames Atticus, and
                begins<br />
                following Helen Robinson while whispering obscenities at her.<br />
                Aunt Alexandra believes Bob holds a grudge against everyone<br />
                connected with the trial. That Halloween, the town sponsors a<br />
                pageant at the school.

                On their way home from the pageant, Scout and Jem are
                attacked.<br />
                They struggle until suddenly the assailant is pulled away and<br />
                Scout stumbles home, seeing a man carrying Jem toward her
                house.<br />
                Scout learns that Bob Ewell is lying dead under a tree and
                she<br />
                realizes that the man who brought Jem home is Boo Radley.
                Heck<br />
                Tate tells Atticus that though Boo is the one who stabbed
                Bob,<br />
                Heck would rather have the whole affair hushed up to spare
                Boo.<br />
                Scout walks Boo home, imagining the world from his perspective.
